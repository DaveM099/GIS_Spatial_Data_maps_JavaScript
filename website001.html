                <h4>
                    Site Summary:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    My site includes five google maps(Barcelona, Barcelona2.0, Spain_Polygon, KML Maps) and two bing maps(BCN Bing and bing GeoJson).  Each map is contained in a card which functions as a link to where you can find the map and the code, and includes a small description of its features.
                    The google maps feature: Polylines, infoWindows, polygons, event listeners, and markers.  The Barcelona map additonally includes event listeners to span back to centre of map after 5 seconds of being moved, and its polyline calculates the distance between the Airport and the Sagrada familia.  In the modified Barcelona 2.0 the styling has been changed and features event listeners to span the map back to the center of Barcelona after 3 seconds of being moved.  In the Spain_Polygon you can find event listerners and bounds to limit the google map to just Spain, with a polygon between 3 spanish airports/ markers with infowindows..  Research was undertaken to find appropiate KML files of Spain, in the Madrid KML link it features a google map showing the bicycle parking areas of the city.  This was read from an external KML file found on a spanish goverment website called datos.gob.es at https://datos.gob.es/en/sector/medio-ambiente.

                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Bing maps you can find customised pushpins of the Airport and the sagrada familia with a custom styles polyline in between them.  This map also features infoboxes that appear in the center of the map when a pushpin is clicked with the help of events handlers.

                    The Spain GeoJson map was created using the custom made GeoJson online and then parsed into the Bing Api, showing some of the major aiports in Spain as well as a polygon of Portugal.
